## Summary / Overview of our project 🗺️🎆💡

**Project Overview:**
This project explores the factors influencing song popularity and trends in the music industry. The aim is to provide valuable insights for artists, producers, and marketers to optimize content creation and audience engagement.

**Purpose of the Research:**
- Analyze the impact of song attributes such as genre, duration, and explicit content on popularity.
- Identify trends in song releases and patterns in artist performance over time.
- Offer actionable recommendations to enhance content strategies.

**Dataset Details:**
The dataset includes comprehensive attributes for each song, such as title, artist, album, genre, duration, popularity scores, streaming counts, and release dates.

**Data Cleaning Process:**
Key steps include handling missing data, converting song durations to minutes for readability, standardizing date formats, and removing duplicates to ensure data accuracy.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Pop and Hip-Hop genres show high popularity, while niche genres like Jazz cater to specific audiences.
- Medium-length songs (3-4 minutes) generally perform better.
- Songs with explicit content often become popular, especially in Rap and Hip-Hop.
- English is the dominant language, with notable diversity from Spanish and French songs.

**Trend Visualization:**
Time-series analyses and data smoothing techniques (e.g., moving averages) were used to highlight trends in song popularity and release patterns.

**Visualization Insights:**
Dashboards feature various charts such as gauges, donut charts, and line graphs to explore data by genre, language, release year, and other attributes. Summary pages provide detailed visual representations like bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and decomposition trees.

**Conclusions and Recommendations:**
- **Findings:** Pop and Rock are the most popular genres. Songs lasting 3-4 minutes are more likely to be popular. The proportion of explicit songs has increased significantly, particularly after 2010.
- **Recommendations:** Focus on emerging genres for new opportunities, optimize song length for higher engagement and leverage language trends to reach global audiences.
